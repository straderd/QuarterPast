# QuarterPast
2020 GameDev.tv Community Jam submission by David Strader

My submission to the 2020 GameDev.tv Game Jam: https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-community-jam

The assigned theme was "Time."

Inspired by classic Asteroids, Fishy, and the friction of reading manual clocks, your goal is to collide with clocks of lesser value while avoided clocks of higher value. Every successful hit advances your current time, and you can score combos with projectile minute hands!

A bonus Hourglass spawns every 12 hours to restore health. Enemy speed and frequency increases every 24 hours. Brush up on your "circle time" and survive as long as possible!
